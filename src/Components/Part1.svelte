  Imagine a regular internet user, trying to find information on the web.
  They type in a search query and hit enter. How would you, as a search engine provider,
  deliver to the user what they want? In the early internet, manually curated web 
  directories were the primary way to find information. But we need a better way.
  We need a way to rank web pages based on their importance. This is where PageRank comes in.
