    PageRank is a powerful algorithm that has shaped the way we interact with the web. 
    Of course, the algorithm alone can be gamed. Google has since introduced many other 
    techniques to improve search results, such as click-through rates, bounce rates, time 
    spent on page, NLP, and more. If the recent Google algorithm 
    leak is to be real, there are currently 14k+ ranking features that comprise Google search. 
    A whole industry has been built around optimizing for Google's search engine. It remains 
    to be seen whether someone can come up with a search engine that can compete with 
    Google's. To learn more about how search engine algorithms work 
    one should study network science, graph theory, and markov chains.
